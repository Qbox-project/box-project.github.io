# Converting from QBCore

1. Check your job grades in `qbx_core/shared/jobs.lua`.
  In Qbox, job grades are numbers without quotations, whereas in QBCore they are strings.
2. Configure ox_inventory and convert your database.
  Back it up first! ([see ox_inventory documentation](https://overextended.dev/ox_inventory/Frameworks/qb))
3. Qbox has multicharacter built into qbx_core.
  If you want to keep using your own multicharacter resource, configure qbx_core accordingly.
  Otherwise you can disable or delete your old multicharacter resource.
4. Qbox has a queue system built into qbx_core.
  If you want to keep using your own queue system, specify `set qbx:enablequeue "true"` inside your cfg file.
  Otherwise you can disable or delete your old queue system.
5. Qbox maintains a qb-core compatibility layer so all existing qb-core resources should expect compatibility most times.
  You can continue using `exports['qb-core']`, however, this means you won't get access to all the new Qbox features and functions, so consider switching off of `exports['qb-core']` when you can.
  Do note that undocumented and invalid usages of qb-core are not supported and may not be in the future.
  See the [FAQ](./faq#will-my-qbcore-scripts-work-with-qbox) for more details.

## Migrating a resource from QBCore to Qbox

Within Qbox, the core object no longer exists.
Instead, the data can be accessed via a combination of export functions and imported modules.

1. Import the needed modules from qbx_core to supply replacement functions for ones from QBCore;
2. Replace calls to QBCore one by one with calls to the imported modules and exported functions. Both can be used at the same time, so conversion can be done partially, or over time.

### Common replacements

```lua
QBCore.Functions. -> exports.qbx_core:
QBCore.Functions.GetPlayerData() -> QBX.PlayerData -- requires importing the playerdata module
QBCore.Functions.GetPlate(vehicle) -> qbx.getVehiclePlate(vehicle) -- requires importing the lib module
QBCore.Shared.Jobs -> exports.qbx_core:GetJobs()
QBCore.Shared.Gangs -> exports.qbx_core:GetGangs()
QBCore.Shared.Vehicles -> exports.qbx_core:GetVehiclesByName()
QBCore.Shared.Weapons -> exports.qbx_core:GetWeapons()
QBCore.Shared.Locations -> exports.qbx_core:GetLocations()
QBCore.Shared.Items -> exports.ox_inventory:Items()

exports['qb-core']:KeyPressed() -> lib.hideTextUI()
exports['qb-core']:HideText() -> lib.hideTextUI()
exports['qb-core']:DrawText(text, position) -> lib.showTextUI(text, { position = position })
exports['qb-core']:ChangeText(text, position) -> lib.hideTextUI() lib.showTextUI(text, { position = position })
```
