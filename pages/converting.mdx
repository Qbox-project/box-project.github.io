# Converting to Qbox from Qb

1. Check your job grades in `qbx-core/shared/jobs.lua`. In Qbox, job grades are numbers without quotations, whereas in Qb they are strings.
2. Configure ox_inventory and convert your database. Back it up first! https://overextended.dev/ox_inventory/Frameworks/qb
3. For security, by default Qbox sets entity lock down mode to relaxed, which prevents clients from spawning networked entities. If you need to change this setting to support scripts that do this, set convar qbx:bucketlockdownmode to 'inactive'
4. Qbox has multicharacter built-in to core. If you want to keep using your own multicharacter resource, disable core's via core config. Otherwise delete your multicharacter resource.
