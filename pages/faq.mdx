# Frequently Asked Questions

## What are the differences between QBCore and Qbox?

While originally forked from QBCore, many Qbox resources have been refactored to improve code quality, enhance security, lower performance overhead, and integrate with [overextended](https://overextended.dev) resources.
Where appropriate Qbox also integrates directly with other open source projects, rather than maintaining subpar resources in-house.

Qbox maintains high quality standards, with a strong community of regular contributors.
As time goes on, expect greater differences in player facing features.

## Will my QBCore scripts work with Qbox?

Yes. We've created a bridge layer for backwards compatibility with QBCore scripts. You can continue to use them without any modifications.

## Who should use Qbox?

Servers currently using QBCore and servers interested in running QBCore in the future.

## Is Qbox ready to use?

Since qbx_core is backwards compatible with qb-core resources, we recommend using only the released Qbox resources for a stable experience.

## Which resources are ready to use?

- qbx_core
- qbx_divegear
- qbx_diving
- qbx_binoculars
- qbx_management

## Common Problems

### No such export GetCoreObject in resource qbx_core

Qbox does not have the core object. However, you can continue to use `exports['qb-core']:GetCoreObject()` to get a core object from Qbox's QB bridge layer.
