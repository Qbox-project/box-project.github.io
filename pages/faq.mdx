# Frequently Asked Questions

## What are the differences between Qb and Qbox?

While originally forked from Qb, many Qbox resources have been refactored to improve code quality, enhance security, lower performance overhead, and integrate with [overextended](https://overextended.dev) resources.
Where appropriate Qbox also integrates directly with other open source projects, rather than maintain subpar resources in-house.
Qbox maintains high quality standards, with a strong community of regular contributors. As time goes on, expect greater differences in player facing features.

## Will Qb compatible scripts work with Qbox?

Most will as we've attempted to maintain backwards compatibility wherever possible. However, some scripts may require slight modifications to be compatible with Qbox.

## When will Qbox get a stable release?

Expect individual resources to get versioned releases over the coming months as they get stabilized and tested.

## Who should use Qbox?

Qbox is still effectively in an open beta. Users interested in contributing or helping to test and report bugs who don't need a stable framework should use Qbox.
