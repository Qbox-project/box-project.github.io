# Frequently Asked Questions

## What are the differences between QBCore and Qbox?

While originally forked from QBCore, many Qbox resources have been refactored to improve code quality, enhance security, lower performance overhead, and integrate with [overextended](https://overextended.dev) resources.
Where appropriate Qbox also integrates directly with other open source projects, rather than maintaining subpar resources in-house.

Qbox maintains high quality standards, with a strong community of regular contributors.
As time goes on, expect greater differences in player facing features.

## Will my QBCore scripts work with Qbox?

TL;DR: Yes (in most cases).

We've created a bridge layer for backwards compatibility with the documented and proper ways of using qb-core,
and you can continue to use most QBCore scripts without any modifications.

An exception to this is resources that use qb-core in undocumented, unsupported, invalid, and/or improper ways, such as:
- Direct access to database tables;
- Direct access to qb-core files that aren't meant to be used by other resources;
- Invalid usages of existing functions;
- And other unexpected ways not mentioned here.

## Who should use Qbox?

Servers currently using QBCore and servers interested in running QBCore in the future.

## Is Qbox ready to use?

Since qbx_core is backwards compatible with qb-core resources, we recommend using only the released Qbox resources for a stable experience.

## Which resources are ready to use?

- [qbx_core](./resources/qbx_core)
- [qbx_divegear](./resources/qbx_divegear)
- [qbx_diving](./resources/qbx_diving)
- [qbx_binoculars](./resources/qbx_binoculars)
- [qbx_management](./resources/qbx_management)
- [qbx_radio](./resources/qbx_radio)
- [qbx_truckrobbery](./resources/qbx_truckrobbery)

## Are multijob resources compatible with Qbox?

They can be, but only if calling qbx_core exports to add/modify/remove player's jobs.
The two common issues with multijob resources are:
- Directly accessing Qbox's database tables
- Maintaining Qbox's core data in a resource's own table

## Common Problems

### No such export GetCoreObject in resource qbx_core

Qbox does not have the core object. However, you can continue to use `exports['qb-core']:GetCoreObject()` to get a core object from Qbox's QB bridge layer.

### [WARN] This resource is still using the deprecated qbx_core utils! ###

This is purely a warning that can be ignored. QBox resources are actively being worked on to remove dependency on the legacy qbx_core utils module and move to the new qbx_core lib module.
