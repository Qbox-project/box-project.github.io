# Import

In the core you will find an import.lua file.

This file is used to import a module system into your resource.

You can use it to manage certain modules from any resource.

## Format

The format for the modules has four ways to specify them:

1. `'module_name'`
2. `'side:module_name'`, `side` can be `client`, `server` or `shared`, if it's neither of them it defaults to shared.
3. `'resource_name:module_name'`
4. `'resource_name:side:module_name'`

These four ways allow you to specify any module you want, as long as it's in a modules folder inside the specified resource.
It defaults to the resource it's loaded in if no resource is specified, meaning it will load it from yourResourceName/modules/

## Example

You have a resource named 'test' and in that resource you have a folder called `modules` (mandatory for the modules to be found).

Inside the modules folder you have a file named `hack.lua`.

You can load this inside another resource you have, for example one named 'test_hack'.

You can add the following to your fxmanifest.lua to then add the module in there:

```lua
shared_script '@qbx-core/import.lua'

module 'test:hack'
```

or

To specify multiple modules

```lua
shared_script '@qbx-core/import.lua'

modules {
    'test:hack',
}
```

That code will now load the hack.lua inside the test/modules/ folder into the test_hack resource as it's own script.

That means you can use it like any other script you have in your own resource.
