# hooks

Event hooks allow 3rd party resources to define new behaviour without modifying your resource directly.

## registerHook

Registers a callback function to be triggered by a resource. Returning false from the callback function cancels the event

```lua
exports.my_resource:registerHook(eventName, cb)
```

- eventName: `string`
- payload: `table`

Return:

- hookId: `number`

## removeHooks

Remove a previously registered hook by it's id.
If no id is provided then all hooks registered by the resource are removed.

```lua
exports.my_resource:removeHooks(id)
```

- id?: `number`
