# Release Readiness

A resource is release ready when all of the following are true

## Code Quality
1. No lint errors
2. prints replaced with lib.print
3. ox_lib is used to replace natives where possible
4. Code has been refactored to use best practices and following style guide
5. Code is readable and well organized
6. No deprecated functions are being invoked

## Core Practices
1. Client PlayerData is accessed using playerdata module, instead of a core export

## Resource Quality
1. Resource features provide a good experience for players/devs/owners/admins
2. Resource is scoped appropriately (i.e. it shouldn't be split, or combined with another resource)
3. README is not outdated
4. No known bugs

## Stability
1. No breaking changes are planned in the near future
2. Resource has been tested or unchanged for long enough to give confidence that major bugs are not present

## Dependencies
1. Dependencies are declared and enforced using [lib.checkDependency](https://overextended.dev/ox_lib/Modules/Version/Shared), NOT fxmanifest dependencies
2. Dependencies are stable
