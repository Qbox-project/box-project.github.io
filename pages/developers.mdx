# Developer's Guide

This guide is intended for those creating scripts using qbx_core.
Following these principles will make it less likely for your script to break in future updates.

## Do not access database tables owned by core

Doing this will break your script if the database schema changes in the future.
If the data you need can't be read or written using a core function,
create a GitHub issue so we can rectify the problem for everyone.

## Do not modify core code

Doing this will make it difficult for you to update in the future, and create confusion when debugging issues that may or may not be due to your custom changes.

We've attempted to design things with flexibility in mind. \
However, if you really feel you need to modify core, file a GitHub issue first.
We'll see if we can trigger an event for you, surface a config value, or re-design something for the flexibility you need.

## Do not use deprecated functions/events

These are likely to be removed in future updates.
